# Write a program that defines a function sum_avg() to accept marks of five subjects and calculates total and average. It should return directly both values.

def sum_avg(marks):
    total = sum(marks)
    average = total / len(marks)
    return total, average

marks = [90, 80, 70, 60, 50]
total, average = sum_avg(marks)
print(f"Total: {total}, Average: {average}")
